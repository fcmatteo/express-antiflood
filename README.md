# express-antiflood
An antiflood middleware for Express. This is NOT ready for production as there are not production-ready stores yet. I am building one that uses Redis. Keep in mind that I'm doing this in my free time, so be kind üòÅ.
There is a first version of the [Redis store here](https://github.com/fcmatteo/express-antiflood-redis). It's not recommended to use it in production yet but it can be tried out. 

# Installation
    npm install express-antiflood

# TODO:
* Improve readme!
